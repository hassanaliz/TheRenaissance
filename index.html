		<p class = "infoportion">The Renaissance was a period of European cultural&sbquo; economic&sbquo; political and artist &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo;. Taking place from the 14th to 17th century&sbquo; the Renaissance
		fueled the rediscovery of classical philosophy&sbquo; literature and art. Credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and Modern-Day Civilization&sbquo; the Renaissance

		<h2 class = "infoheading">Humanism</h2>
		<img src = "Images/humanismimg1.jpg" alt = "The painting Virtue Triumphant over Vice by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna" class = "HumanismMedici">
		<p class = "infoportion">Although the essence of the Renaissance was manifested through various forms&sbquo; one of the first was Humanism. Humanism was a cultural movement that first appeared near the 
		beginning of the Renaissance. Humanism was put into action by secular men of letters rather than by the scholar-clerics who had taken over intellectual life during the <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages">Medieval times</a>
		and created the <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scholasticism">Scholastic philosophy</a>. Humanism was first established and initiated in Italy&sbquo; and predecessors of the movement include men like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch">Pretrarch</a>&sbquo; while 
		its chief protagonists included <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannozzo_Manetti">Giannozzo Manetti</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bruni">Leonardo Bruni</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino">Marsilio Ficino</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola">Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla">Lorenzo Valla</a>&sbquo; and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati">Coluccio Salutati</a>. Now&sbquo; let&rsquo;s look at what 
		humanism actually is. Humanism had several features&sbquo; one of which being that it took human nature in all its various manifestations and achievements as its subject. The 
		second one was that it put emphasis on the unity and truth found in philosophical and theological schools and systems (a belief called <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/topic/religious-syncretism">syncretism</a>). Lastly&sbquo; it looked forward to a rebirth 
		in human spirit and wisdom. To summarize&sbquo; the desired effect of humanism was to help men break free from restrictions imposed by religious orthodoxies&sbquo; to inspire free inquiry
		and critique&sbquo; and to put more confidence into the possibilities of human thoughts and creations. Humanism and the Renaissance it enveloped spread North from Italy to all parts of Europe&sbquo;
		through the invention of printing&sbquo; which allowed availability to classical texts increase tenfold. However&sbquo; by the end of the 16th century&sbquo; the battle of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Reformation">Reformation</a>
		and <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> had taken over majority of Europe&sbquo; while intellectual life was put on the brink of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history">Enlightenment.</a></p>

		<h2 class = "infoheading">The Medeci Family</h2>
		<img src = "Images/medicifamily.jpg" alt = "This is an image of the Medici family" class = "HumanismMedici">
		<p class = "infoportion">The Renaissance began in Florence&sbquo; Italy&sbquo; a place with rich cultural history&sbquo; and wealthy citizens were able to help flourishing artists. One particularly notable family was the 
		Medici Family. The Medici Family ruled Florence for 60 years&sbquo; and were great backers of the Renaissance movement. They were praised by great Italian writers&sbquo; artists and politicians for participating in
		an intellectual and artistic revolution which would be much different than what they experienced during the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)">Dark Ages</a>. The movement first spread to to other Italian city-states&sbquo; including Venice&sbquo; 
		Milan&sbquo; Bologna&sbquo; Ferreira and Rome. Then&sbquo; during the 15th century&sbquo; Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France and then throughout Western and Northern Europe. Although other European countries
		experienced their Renaissance later than Italy&sbquo; the impacts were still revolutionary and undoubtedly fueled by the powerful Medici family who assisted in the expansion of the movement from the very beginning.</p>

		<!-- This is the "Advancements made during the Renaissance" section, paragraphs and images that are placed within a list are wrapped in a list element to avoid errors with the validator -->
		<p class = "infoportion">As foreshadowed earlier&sbquo; many scientific&sbquo; architectural and artistic advancements were made during the Renaissance. Here&sbquo; we&rsquo;ll be discussing a few significant ones. Before we list advancements
		made in different fields&sbquo; it&rsquo;s important to note that science&sbquo; art and architecture were very closely related during the Renaissance. All three fields went hand-in-hand with one another&sbquo; and discoveries
		in each were linked to work done in the other.</p>

			<li class = "specialli"><p>Through increased scientific research and discovery&sbquo; artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci were able to incorporate human anatomy into their artwork&sbquo; to replicate and assist scientists with their research. 
			Art was closely intertwined with science through creating visual models of discoveries that scientists had made surrounding astronomy and anatomy. It&rsquo;s also important to note that art and artistic perspectives 
			became generally more accepted and sought-after during the Renaissance&sbquo; which is an achievement in itself. Renaissance art was characterized by naturalism and realism. It aimed to portray objects and people as realistically 
			as possible&sbquo; which intertwined with research scientists were conducting at the time.</p></li>

			<li class = "specialli"><p>Along with art&sbquo; advancements in the architectural realm were equally as revolutionary. Famous architects such as <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Filippo-Brunelleschi">Filippo Brunelleschi</a> studied mathematics to design impressive and at the time&sbquo; unprecedented 
			buildings&sbquo; such as buildings shaped as domes. Artistic and visual models of buildings also played a fundamental role in the advancement of architecture as it gave architects a visual base to build off&sbquo; rather

			<li class = "specialli"><img src = "Images/nicolasCopernicus.jpg" alt = "Drawing of Nicolaus Copernicus" id = "NiCo"></li>
			<li class = "specialli"><p>Many revolutionary scientific ideas were proposed during the Renaissance&sbquo; however two of the most notable would be in the fields of astronomy and anatomy. In terms of astronomy&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> proposed a theory stating that 
			Sun was the center of the solar system instead of the Earth&sbquo; which was the widely accepted theory until that point. Biology was also another field that faced great advancements during the Renaissance. Human anatomy became more well 
			studied during the Renaissance&sbquo; and research about the human skeleton was conducted. Other notable scientists who provided a new view surrounding mathematics and astronomy include <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">Descartes.</a></p></li>

		<img src = "Images/counterReformation.jpg" alt = "Painting of the Catholic Church" id = "catholicChurch">
		<p class = "infoportion">It is widely believed by many scholars that the Renaissance ended due to a variety of circumstantial reasons. By the end of the 15th century&sbquo; the Italian peninsula was undergoing many wars. Spanish&sbquo; French and German invaders started to battle for Italian territories&sbquo; which caused
		disruption and instability in the region. Additionally&sbquo; changing trade routes led to a period of economic decline&sbquo; which resulted in less money for wealthy contributers to spend on art. Later on&sbquo; in a movement known as <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">the Catholic church</a>
		began to censor artists and writers in response to the <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/protestant-reformation/#:~:text=The%20Protestant%20Reformation%20was%20a&sbquo;due%20to%20differences%20in%20doctrine.">Protestant Reformation</a>. As a result of this&sbquo; Renaissance artists &rdquo;toned down&ldquo; their artwork out of fear of being too bold. Moreover&sbquo; in 1545&sbquo; the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent">Council of Trent</a> established the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition">Roman Inquisition</a>&sbquo;
		which made humanism and any other views that went against the Catholic church an act of heresy punishable by death. Due to all these factors combined&sbquo; historians believe that by the early 17th century&sbquo; the Renaissance movement had died out&sbquo; which gave way to the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment#:~:text=The%20Age%20of%20Enlightenment%20(also&sbquo;with%20global%20influences%20and%20effects.">Age
