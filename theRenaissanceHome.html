		<p class = "infoparagraph">The Renaissance was a period of European cultural, economic, political and artist &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo;. Taking place from the 14th to 17th century&sbquo; the Renaissance
		fueled the rediscovery of classical philosophy&sbquo; literature and art. Credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and Modern-Day Civilization, the Renaissance 
		is an undeniably important and captivating time in history.</p>

		<h2 class = "infoheading">Humanism</h2>
		<img src = "humanismimg1.jpg" alt = "The painting Virtue Triumphant over Vice by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna" id = "humanismimg1">
		<p class = "infoparagraph">Although the essence of the Renaissance was manifested through various forms&sbquo; one of the first was Humanism. Humanism was a cultural movement that first appeared near the 
		beginning of the Renaissance. Humanism was put into action by secular men of letters rather than by the scholar-clerics who had taken over intellectual life during the Medieval times
		and created the Scholastic philosophy. Humanism was first established and initiated in Italy&sbquo; and predecessors of the movement include men like Dante and Pretrach, while it&rsquo;
		s chief protagonists included Gianozzo Manetti, Leonardo Bruni, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Lorenzo Valla&sbquo; and Coluccio Salutati. Now&sbquo; let&rsquo;s look at what 
		humanism actually is. Humanism had several features&sbquo; one of which being that it took human nature in all it's various manifestations and achievements as it&rsquo; subject. The 
		second one was that it put emphasis on the unity and truth found in philosophical and theological schools and systems (a belief called synscism). Lastly, it looked forward to a rebirth 
		in human spirit and wisdom. To summarize&sbquo; the desired effect of humanism was to help men break free from restrictions imposed by religious orthodoxies&sbquo; to inspire free inquiry
		and critique&sbquo;and to put more confidence into the possibilities of human thoughts and creations.Humanism and the Renaissance it enveloped spread north from Italy to all parts of Europe,
		as printing had recently been created&sbquo; which allowed availability to classical texts increase tenfold. However&sbquo; by the end of the 16th century&sbquo; the battle of Reformation
		and counter-Reformation had taken majority of Europe&sbquo; while intellectual life was put on the brink of Enlightenment.</p>

		<h2 class = "infoheading">The Medeci Family</h2>
		<img src = "medicifamily.jpg" alt = "This is an image of the Medici family" id = "medicifamily">
		<p class = "infoparagraph">The Renaissance began in Florence&sbquo; Italy&sbquo; a place with rich cultural history, wealthy citizens were able to help flourishing artists. One particularly notable wealthy family was the 
		Medici Family. The Medici Family ruled Florence for 60 years, and were great bakers of the Renaissance movement. Credited by great Italian writers&sbquo; artists&sbquo; politicians and others for participating in
		an intellectual and artistic revolution which would be much different than what they experienced during the Dark Ages. The movement first spread to to other Italian city-states, including Venice&sbquo; 
		Milan&sbquo; Bologna&sbquo; Ferrara and Rome. Then, during the 15th century, Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France and then throughout western and northern Europe. Although other European countries
		experienced their Renaissance later than Italy, the impacts were still revolutionary and undoubtedly fueled by the powerful Medici family who assisted in the expansion of the movement from the very beginning.</p>
		<h2 class = "infoheading">Advancements Made During the Renaissance</h2>
		<p class = "infoparagraph">As foreshadowed earlier&sbquo; many scientific&sbquo; architectural and artist advancements were made during the Renaissance. Here&sbquo; we'll be discussing a few significant ones. Before we list advancements
		made in different fields&sbquo; it&rsquo;s important to note that science, art and architecture were very closely related during the Renaissance. All three fields went hand-in-hand with one another, and discoveries
		in each were linked to work done in the other.</p>
		<ol class = "infoparagraph">
			<li class = "listitems">Art</li>
			<p>Through increased scientific research and discovery,&sbquo; artists such as Da Vinci were able to incorporate human anatomy into their artwork, to repliccate and assist scientists with their research. 
			Art was closely intertwined with science through creating visual models of discoveries that scientists had made surrounding astronomy and anatomy paticularly. It&rsquo;s also important to note that art and artistic prespectives 
			became generally more accepted and sought-after during the Renaissance, which is an achievement in itself. Renaissance art was characterizied by naturalism and realism. It aimed to protray objects and people as real 
			as possible&sbquo; which intertwined with research scientists were conducting at the time.
			<li class = "listitems">Architecture</li>
			<p>Along with art&sbquo; advancements in the architectural realm were equally as revolutionary. Famous architiects such as Filippo Brunelleschi studied mathematics to design impressive and at the time, unprecedented 
			buildings&sbquo; such as buildings shaped as domes. Artistic and visual models of buildings also played a fundamental role in the advancement of architecture as it gave aarchitects a visual base to build off, rather 
			than only mathematics.
			<li class = "listitems">Science</li>
			<p>Many revolutionary scientific ideas were discovered during the Renaissance&sbquo; however two of the most notable would be in the fields of astronomy and anatomy. In terms of astronomy&sbquo; Copernicus proposed a theoryy stating that 
			Sun was the center of the solar system instead of the Earth&sbquo; which was the widely accepted theory until that point. Biology was also another field that faced great advancements during the Renaissance. Human anatomy became more well 
			studied&sbquo; and research about the human skeleton was conducted. Other notable scientists who provided a new view surrounding mathematics and astronomy include Galileo and Descartes.

		<h1 id = "high" class = "infoheading">High Renaissance</h1>
		<p class = "infoparagraph"> Put simply&sbquo;in terms of art history&sbquo; the High Renaissance was short period of the most exceptional art creation in Italian states (particularly Rome and Florence). Renowned atrists, sculpters and architects of this time include Leonardo Da Vinci, 
		Michealangelo, Raphael, and Bramante. Majority of art historians believe that the High Renaissance ended start between 1495-1500&sbquo; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael. However&sbquo;some belueve that the High Renaissance ended around 1525-1527 with the Sack of Tome by the
		army of Charles V. The High Renaissance style in architecture starts with Donato Bramte, whose Tempeiio.
